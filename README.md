Plan
    1) Crawler that scrapes events from department websites and TigerQuest and popoulates the DB
    2) ChatBot written in Python that interfaces with the Twilio API to text people
    3) DB that stores data about users and events to generate the graph
    4) Recomendation system that maps user preferences to events
